OVH Click2Call
=============

We use this little system to allow people to place calls from lets say a CRM such as Dolibarr or a Mac OS Address Book application. This uses OVH SOAPI and MGCP phones.

* If you're gonna use the Address Book script, think of editing it first to set the correct path to the call.php file
* The call.php file needs to be configured regardless what you wanna use this for
